Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification: Cat vs Dog

Introduction

In this project, I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either a cat or a dog. Using a standard CNN architecture, I trained the model on a dataset of labeled cat and dog images. The goal was to create an efficient machine learning model capable of accurately classifying unseen images from a test set and making predictions on new, real-world images.
