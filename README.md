Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification: Cat vs Dog

Introduction

In this project, I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either cats or dogs. Using the standard CNN architecture, I trained the model on a dataset labeled with cat and dog images. The goal is to create an efficient machine learning model that can accurately classify image data from test sets and make predictions about images
