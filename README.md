Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification: Cat vs Dog

Introduction

In this project, I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either cats or dogs. Using the standard CNN architecture, I trained the model on a dataset labeled with cat and dog images. The goal is to create an efficient machine learning model that can accurately classify image data from test sets and make predictions about images

# Project: CNN for Image Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The project demonstrates how to train a CNN, preprocess data, and make predictions on new images.

## Purpose of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate a CNN for the classification of images as either a cat or a dog. The model aims to accurately classify new images that were not part of the training set.

## Machine Learning Model
- **Model Architecture**: A CNN model with multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
- **Training**: The model was trained using 8,000 images (4,000 cats and 4,000 dogs), and tested on 2,000 images.
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam Optimizer

## Results
- **Training Accuracy**: Approximately 98%
- **Test Accuracy**: Approximately 97%
- **Prediction**: The model successfully classified images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates categorical predictions for two types of picture data
